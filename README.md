# GitHub Organization Repo Cloner

This script allows you to clone and periodically pull updates from all repositories within a specified GitHub organization.

## Setup

1. You need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

2. Install the required Python packages with pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Copy the .env.example file to .env in the same directory:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. Edit the .env file with your GitHub organization name and your GitHub Personal Access Token:

    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```

5. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The script will clone all the repositories from the specified organization into the current directory, and it will periodically pull updates every 5 minutes (or as specified in the DELAY environment variable).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please check the log messages for more information.

You may need to generate a new GitHub Personal Access Token if the script can't authenticate with GitHub.
